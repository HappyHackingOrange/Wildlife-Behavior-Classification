# Wildlife-Behavior-Classification
A project portfolio in development and application of statistical and machine learning techniques in carnivore behavior studies

## Description

This is a project portfolio that showcases results of application of statistical and machine learning techniques in analysis of carnivore movement and accelometer data.  GPS transmitters were used for estimating carnivores' locations and dual-axial accelerometers used for measuring 2-dimensional accelerations of carnivores' motion.  Machine learning and other advanced statistical methods bridge conceptual models to data, providing insights into ecological and physiological mechanisms underlying carnivore behavior and movements.  This research project experimented the appplications of hidden Markov models, support vector machine, clustering techniques, a local convex hull method, and more, in the inference of carnivore behavior from movement data.  

## Carnivore movement modelling using Hidden Markov Models

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were applied on step lengths and turning angles derived from GPS location data, to understand movement patterns of two competing carnivore species and to discern factors influencing these patterns. Four distinct movement modes were identified, from most stationary to most active.  Most stationary mode is characterized by short step lengths and turning angles around 180 degrees, while most active mode is characterized by long step lengths and turning angles around zero degree.
